## 🔧 Backend API Endpoints Created:

```
GET  /api/v1/enrollments/my-purchases   - Get all user purchases
GET  /api/v1/enrollments/my-courses     - Get user's courses only
GET  /api/v1/enrollments/my-scripts     - Get user's scripts only
```

### Admin Endpoints:
```
GET    /api/v1/admin/users-enrollments  - View all users + enrollments
POST   /api/v1/admin/assign-product     - Assign course/script to user
DELETE /api/v1/admin/remove-product     - Remove from user
```

## 🎨 Frontend Changes Required:

### 1. Update Main Website (index.html):
- ✅ Already shows all products (no changes needed)
- ✅ Add to cart requires login (already done)

### 2. Create "My Courses" Page:
```javascript
// Fetch user's enrolled courses
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/enrollments/my-courses', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
const { courses } = await response.json();
// Display only these courses
```

### 3. Create "My Scripts" Page:
```javascript
// Fetch user's purchased scripts
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/enrollments/my-scripts', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
const { scripts } = await response.json();
// Display only these scripts
```

### 4. Admin Panel - Add "User Enrollments" Tab:
- List all users
- Show their purchases
- Assign/Remove buttons

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps:

1. ✅ Backend routes added to `server.js`
2. ✅ Order model created
3. ✅ User purchase tracking ready
4. 🔄 Need to add Admin UI (enrollments tab)
5. 🔄 Need to create "My Courses" page (frontend)
6. 🔄 Need to integrate payment verification with auto-enrollment

---

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### Priority 1: Add Admin UI
Create section in `admin.html`:
- Tab: "User Enrollments"
- Load users from `/api/v1/admin/users-enrollments`
- Show table with assign/remove buttons

### Priority 2: Payment Verification Flow
When admin verifies payment:
1. Get order items
2. For each item, add to user's `purchases` array
3. Update order status to 'verified'
4. Send confirmation email (optional)

### Priority 3: User Dashboard
Create "My Learning" page:
- Show purchased courses
- Show purchased scripts
- Access/Download buttons
