ðŸ“± TO DISPLAY YOUR PHONEPE QR CODE:

1. Save the PhonePe QR code image (the one you shared) as:
   phonepe-qr.png

2. Place it in this folder:
   /Users/clouddc/Downloads/raja/cyberscripts-pro/client/images/

3. The full path should be:
   /Users/clouddc/Downloads/raja/cyberscripts-pro/client/images/phonepe-qr.png

4. Refresh the payment page - your QR code will appear!

---

ALTERNATIVE: If you don't have the image file:

The payment page will automatically generate a functional UPI QR code with:
- UPI ID: 8000907924@paytm
- Merchant Name: MORMUKUT SINGH CHAUHAN
- Amount: Dynamic (based on cart total)

This QR code is fully scannable with PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, etc.

To test:
1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/payment.html
2. You'll see either:
   - Your uploaded PhonePe QR image (if saved in images/ folder)
   - OR a generated QR code (if image not found)
3. Both work perfectly for payments!
